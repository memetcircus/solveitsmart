# Solve It Smart

Solve It Smart is an interactive, AI-powered companion app designed to work alongside the *Catch the Fish: The Evolutionary Playbook of Problem Solving Techniques* iBook. It takes a math or logic problem from the book‚Äîalong with its provided solution and the underlying strategy‚Äîand uses that information to guide a step-by-step explanation using Polya-inspired techniques.

But it goes beyond just explaining the answer.

Solve It Smart allows users to ask follow-up questions about the strategy used (e.g. *Why use cases?*, *Why a table?*, *What does working backwards mean here?*), and it responds conversationally‚Äîlike a smart tutor embedded inside the book.

In short: **Solve It Smart doesn‚Äôt just solve problems‚Äîit teaches how to think through them.**

## üì± Platform & Deployment

- Target: **iPad (iOS)**
- Orientation: **Landscape only**
- Deployment Target: **iOS 16.0**
- Inference: **Fully offline using Google‚Äôs Gemma 3n model** (.gguf format)

---

## ‚ú® Features

Solve It Smart includes several standout features:

- **Offline AI support**: The app runs entirely on-device using the Gemma 3N model. This means users can explore and solve problems‚Äîeven complex ones involving figures and equations‚Äîwithout needing an internet connection.

- **Conversational AI explainers**: Rather than just giving answers, the app explains how and why a strategy works. It applies Polya-style techniques like working backwards or use cases, adapting its response to the specific problem and the user‚Äôs follow-up questions.

- **Math rendering and LaTeX output**: The app dynamically generates LaTeX for each step of the solution. Math is rendered cleanly on-screen, and users can copy any part of the output as LaTeX to reuse elsewhere‚Äîperfect for students or educators working in Overleaf or Markdown environments.

- **Chat-based interface**: Engages users in dialogue, simulating a personal tutor experience.

- **Deep link support**: Opens directly to a problem from the iBook using a GitHub-based redirect.

## üöÄ How It Works

### User Flow:

When users tap a "Solve It Smart" link inside the *Catch the Fish* iBook, the app launches directly into the relevant problem. The app loads:

- The full problem statement
- The book-provided solution
- The problem-solving strategy (e.g. *Use Logic*, *Guess & Test*)

It then begins a Polya-style explanation of how and why the problem was solved that way.

### Ask Questions:

The user can ask things like:

- "Why did you use cases here?"
- "Which techniques did you use in this problem?"
- "Can you explain working backwards technique?"

The AI responds in context, drawing from the model's understanding of the problem, solution, and the chosen strategy.

---

## üîó Deep Linking & Redirects

Since Apple Books doesn't support native deep links, each problem link redirects through a GitHub-hosted redirector. Safari opens briefly, then redirects into the app with the correct problem loaded.

Example redirect:

```
https://memetcircus.github.io/solveitsmart-redirects/?id=2.2
```

## üõ† Architecture Overview

### SwiftUI Views:
- `SplashView.swift`: initial launch screen
- `ContentView.swift`: main problem/AI interaction interface
- `BubbleView.swift`: chat-style interface

### AI Backend:
- `GemmaModel.swift`: manages generation and streaming
- `libllama.swift`: wraps llama.cpp for iOS
- `LlamaContext`: handles tokenization, sampling, decoding

### Data Layer:
- `problems.json`: problem dataset with solutions and techniques
- `ProblemStore.swift`: loads and fetches problem metadata

## üí° Local Inference with Gemma 3n

- Model file: `google_gemma-3n-E2B-it-Q4_K_M.gguf`
- Requires no server or internet connection

**Installation Note:** The model file is not included in the repository. Users must download the `.gguf` file separately and place it inside the project directory under a folder named `models` (lowercase `m`), which is already listed in `.gitignore`.

To download the model, run the following command in your macOS terminal:

```bash
huggingface-cli download bartowski/google_gemma-3n-E2B-it-GGUF \
  --include "google_gemma-3n-E2B-it-Q4_K_M.gguf" \
  --local-dir ./models
```

> üß† Note: Other Gemma 3n variants were tested on the iPad Air 5th generation, but due to memory constraints, this is the most comprehensive model that runs reliably.

---

## üõ† llama.cpp Build (iOS)

To compile the backend AI engine on iOS, follow these steps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp.git
cd llama.cpp

mkdir build-ios && cd build-ios
cmake .. \
 -DLLAMA_METAL=on \
 -DLLAMA_STATIC=on \
 -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES=arm64 \
 -DCMAKE_SYSTEM_NAME=iOS \
 -DCMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT=iphoneos

make
```

This will generate a Metal-optimized static build for iOS.

---

## üìÅ Project Structure & Xcode Configuration

After building `llama.cpp`, navigate to:

```bash
llama.cpp/examples/llama.swiftui/llama.swiftui.xcodeproj
```

Open this project in Xcode to configure and run the app.

Once opened, place your downloaded .gguf model file inside the models directory:

llama.swiftui/models/google_gemma-3n-E2B-it-Q4_K_M.gguf

‚ö†Ô∏è Note:
The models/ folder is excluded from version control via .gitignore,
so you‚Äôll need to manually copy your .gguf file into that folder
after cloning or switching branches

---

## üßº Prompt Engineering

We solved several edge cases:

- Prevent model from re-solving already solved problems
- Block off-topic user queries with scoped prompts
- Avoid math rendering bugs caused by `$...$`
- Prevent technique-switching requests (e.g. ‚ÄúSolve this with another method‚Äù)
- Final answer enforced with:  
  `Finish with the final answer: \(finalAnswer) and nothing else.`

---

## üß∞ Important Code Customization

To avoid a crash when prompts exceed token limits, we modified `LibLlama.swift`:

```swift
func llama_batch_add(_ batch: inout llama_batch, _ id: llama_token, _ pos: llama_pos, _ seq_ids: [llama_seq_id], _ logits: Bool) {

    // üöß SAFETY CHECK: Avoid out-of-bounds access
    let MAX_TOKENS = 512
    guard batch.n_tokens < MAX_TOKENS else {
        print("‚ö†Ô∏è Max token limit reached.")
        return
    }

    // ‚úÖ Safe to access indexed memory now
    batch.token   [Int(batch.n_tokens)] = id
    batch.pos     [Int(batch.n_tokens)] = pos
    batch.n_seq_id[Int(batch.n_tokens)] = Int32(seq_ids.count)

    for i in 0..<seq_ids.count {
        if let ptr = batch.seq_id[Int(batch.n_tokens)] {
            ptr[i] = seq_ids[i]
        } else {
            return
        }
    }
}
```

This check prevents the app from crashing due to memory overflow in prompt handling.
