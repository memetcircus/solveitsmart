We test different values. Try a = 2 → 2 + 2 = 4 (not allowed). Try a = 3 → 3 + 3 = 6 with carry → i = 7. Assume t = 6, a = 3, then r + c must result in a 2-digit number starting with r.

Also, ACD is three times angle CDE, so let angle CDE = y, which means ACD = 3y and x = 3y + 100. In triangle HDE, the interior angles CDE, GED, and FED sum to 180. Since angle GED = 2y (from triangle angle relationships), the sum becomes: 2y + x = 180. Now we have a system of equations: (1) 2y + x = 180 and (2) x − 3y = 100. Solving these equations by substitution or elimination gives y = 16 and x = 148. Therefore, the measure of angle FED is 148."

Given that $$P + N = E + A = R + H$$ , we have $$P + E + R + H + A + N = 3(R + H)$$, so $$R + H$$ must be odd. But since $$I$$ is the middle number in the sequence, by properties of consecutive numbers we get $$(R + H)/2 = I$$. Therefore, $$R + H = 2I$$, which is even.

Then, we must determine its matching value in gold and compare the costs. For example, the total on the fifth day is 1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 = 31 = 2^5 - 1. This pattern generalizes: the total payment on the nth day is 2^n - 1 silver coins. So on the 30th day, the total is $$2^30 - 1 = 1,073,741,823$$ silver coins. Since one gold coin is worth 100 silver coins, this equals about 10,737,418 gold coins. The knight’s request far exceeds the king’s original 100,000 gold coin offer. So King should refuse the offer."
